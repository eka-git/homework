1. ### Experimental Overview  
    1. ##### 【Experiment Project Name】:
        **Ping** a Computer and **Tracert** a Server    
    2. ##### 【Experimental Purpose】:  
        Learning how to ping a computer and tracert a server  
    3. ##### 【Experimental Environment】:
        Windows Powershell  
    4. ##### 【Reference】:
        CSDN community  
2. ### Experimental Content  
    1. ##### 【Experimental Design】:
        (1) The input of different commands to system can be realized through Powershell or Command Prompt. We can via Powershell to realize the **Ping** and **Tracert** command.  
        (2) To record the IP address of another computer and the IP address of the DNS server where our computer is located, we use the Powershell to input the command **"ipconfig /all"**. Then we can get all the information we need.  
        (3) Now we can **ping** a computer and **tracert** a server according to the IP address we have recorded. Try two or three computers and servers.
    2. ##### 【Result】:  
        * If we ping a computer that is not in the same subset with our computer, our computer cannot get the responses of the computer(**"Request Timeout"**). If the ping is successuful, we can get four responses of another computer to determine whether our computer can exchange packets with another computer.  
        * If we tracert a server, we can know the route from the local host to the server.  
        * The result is follows:

    3. ##### 【Conclusion】:  
        * Using Internet to help us with the problems.  
        * Sometimes even if our computer is in the same subset of another computer, we still cannot ping it. To solve this problem, we can turn off the firewall as the firewall may refuse the ping.

1. ### Experimental Overview  
    1. ##### 【Experiment Project Name】:
        Wireshark Introduction
    2. ##### 【Experimental Purpose】:  
        Primarily learn how to get Wireshark up and running and learn some capabilities of Wireshark
    3. ##### 【Experimental Environment】:
        Wireshark 3.6.2
    4. ##### 【Reference】:
        ***Computer Networking A Top-Down Approach***, 8th Edition by James F. Kurose, Keith W. Ross    
        CSDN community
2. ### Experimental Content  
    1. ##### 【Experimental Design】:
        (1) *Getting Wireshark*: We can download Wireshark from **http://www.wireshark.org/download.html**, choosing our needed version. In this lab, we use Wireshark 3.6.2 .
        (2) *Running Wireshark*: We should run the Wireshark program to get the start-up screen to explore the function of Wireshark. 
        (3) *A Test Run*: We use the **capture** function of Wireshark to catch some packets send or receive in our computer. In this lab, to make it clear, we choose to open **http://cs.whu.edu.cn/** in our browser which uses HTTP protocol. Then we can type in *http* in the display filter and read from Wireshark to see the message sending and receiving.  
        (4)*Close*: Save the catched messages and close the Wireshark.
    2. ##### 【Result】:  
        * When we run the Wireshark program, we’ll get a startup screen that looks something like the screen below. There is a row of functions at the top of the page table. Note that under the Capture section, there is a list of so-called interfaces(options). We can capture packets by pressing the start, selecting the interfaces you want to use.
        ![WiresharkScreen.png](https://s2.loli.net/2022/03/02/q9KbehzuI652srW.png)  
        * As our computer is connected in ethernet, we choose the interface **ethernet** to catch packets. When we run the function "capture", we can get lots of packets. Now we run the **http://cs.whu.edu.cn/** page, in order to display this page, our browser will contact the HTTP server at cs.whu.edu.cn and exchange HTTP messages with the server in order to download this page. We can get the HTTP message exchanges with the cs.whu.edu.cn web server should appear somewhere in the listing of packets captured. We input "**http**" in the filter to screen the HTTP messages we need in those packets. We now can read the packets exchanged when opening the page. We can read the packet details in the packet details window.  
        ![Wireshark packet.png](https://s2.loli.net/2022/03/02/GZI91sMfNtcCAHO.png)
    3. ##### 【Conclusion】:  
        * We can read DNS, HTTP, TCP protocols that appear in the protocol column in the unfiltered packet-listing window. There are also others.
        * It takes 0.6s when the HTTP GET message was sent until the HTTP OK reply was received.  
        * In the packets of HTTP, we find that the Internet address of **http://cs.whu.edu.cn/** is 202.114.64.41, the Internet address of our computer is 10.132.89.98  
        * We can print out result by choosing **Print** from the Wireshark File command menu, and select the “Selected Packet Only” and “Print as displayed” radial buttons, and then click OK.

1. ### Experimental Overview  
    1. ##### 【Experiment Project Name】:
        Telnet Hust
    2. ##### 【Experimental Purpose】:  
        learn the function of Telnet  
    3. ##### 【Experimental Environment】:
        Windows Powershell  
    4. ##### 【Reference】:
        CSDN community  
2. ### Experimental Content  
    1. ##### 【Experimental Design】:
        (1) **Telnet** is a standard protocol and main method of Internet  remote logining service. Its basic function is to allow users to log in and enter the remote host system. We use this to do some actions in the remote host system.  
        (2) Open the Windows Powershell, we input the ***telnet mail.hust.edu.cn 25*** commands to connect with the mail.hust.edu.cn; then we input ***telnet cs.hust.edu.cn 80*** to connect with the cs.hust.edu.cn and click with the right mouse button to copy the **GET /index.htm HTTP/1.1** and **host: cs.hust.edu.cn** to the cursor. We see what happens.

    2. ##### 【Result】:  
        * If we connect with the mail.hust.edu.cn, we can get a message as followed picture. The message is **220 mxl.hust.edu.cn ESMTP Smptd** which means that we connect to the mail successfully and **ESMTP Smptd** are Mail Transfer Protocols.  
        ![TelnetMail.png](https://s2.loli.net/2022/03/03/CRG3tTbeKZX7zEn.png)  
        * If we connect with the cs.hust.edu.cn and input the next commands, we can get a lot of messages which are the display(in html) of the page cs.hust.edu.cn. We read the title of this page from those details.  
        ![TelnetCs.png](https://s2.loli.net/2022/03/03/7eYZAM9jQUWRfoO.png)
    3. ##### 【Conclusion】:    
        * If there is Chinese garbled code, we can input **chcp 65001** commands at first in the Powershell.  
        * The command *host* is important as our computer can know where to request from the host name.  
        * We can learn a lot about a HTTP page through the *GET* command.

1. ### Experimental Overview  
    1. ##### 【Experiment Project Name】:
        Wireshark HTTP
    2. ##### 【Experimental Purpose】:  
        We learn to use Wireshark to investigate application layer HTTP protocol, explore several aspects.
    3. ##### 【Experimental Environment】:
        Wireshark 3.6.2
    4. ##### 【Reference】:
        ***Computer Networking A Top-Down Approach***, 8th Edition by James F. Kurose, Keith W. Ross    
        CSDN community 
2. ### Experimental Content  
    1. ##### 【Experimental Design】:
        In this lab, we will explore five aspects of the application layer HTTP protocol: 
        (1) The Basic HTTP GET/RESPONSE Interaction: 
        * Start up our brower.  
        * Start up our Wireshark program. Input "**http**" in the filter to get the HTTP messages we need.  
        * This time we wait more than a minute and start capture. We open the page **http://gaia.cs.umass.edu/wireshark-labs/HTTP-wireshark-file1.html** in our browser.  

        (2) The HTTP CONDITIONAL GET/RESPONSE Interaction:  
        * Start up our web browser, and make sure our browser’s cache is cleared.  
        * Start up our Wireshark program.  
        * Enter the following URL into our browser **http://gaia.cs.umass.edu/wireshark-labs/HTTP-wireshark-file2.html**. Then select the refresh button on our browser.  
        * Stop the Wireshark capture.  

        (3) Retrieving Long Documents:  
        * Start up our web browser, and make sure our browser’s cache is cleared.  
        * Start up our Wireshark program.  
        * Enter the following URL into our browser **http://gaia.cs.umass.edu/wireshark-labs/HTTP-wireshark-file3.html**. Then we stop the Wireshark capture and input **http** in the filter to get the HTTP messages we need.  

        (4) HTML Documents with Embedded Objects:  
        * Start up our web browser, and make sure our browser’s cache is cleared.  
        * Start up our Wireshark program.  
        * Enter the following URL into our browser **http://gaia.cs.umass.edu/wireshark-labs/HTTP-wireshark-file4.html**. Then we stop the Wireshark capture and input **http** in the filter to get the HTTP messages we need.  

        (5) HTTP Authentication:  
        * Start up our web browser, and make sure our browser’s cache is cleared.  
        * Start up our Wireshark program.  
        * Enter the following URL into our browser **http://gaia.cs.umass.edu/wireshark-labs/protected_pages/HTTP-wireshark-file5.html**. And we enter the password and user name in the page's box.  
        * We stop the Wireshark capture and input **http** in the filter to get the HTTP messages we need.

    2. ##### 【Result】:  
        (1) The Basic HTTP GET/RESPONSE Interaction:  
        * In this lab, we can get two HTTP messages in the packet-listing window-----the GET message (from your browser to the gaia.cs.umass.edu web server) and the response message from the server to your browser. We can get many details of the messages from the packet-contents window. 
        * We can read that: our browser and the server is running the HTTP version 1.1; our browser indicate that it can accept to the server by **(zh-CN)**; the IP of our computer is 10.132.89.98 and the IP of the server is 128.119.245.12; the status code returned from the server to our browser is **200**;  the time of the HTML file that we are retrieving last modified at the server is ***Wed, 02 Mar 06:59:01 GMT*** and the file is **128** bytes.  
        ![BasicHTTP](https://s2.loli.net/2022/03/03/mLj1DCwzipK4FPx.png)

        (2) The HTTP CONDITIONAL GET/RESPONSE Interaction:  
        * In this lab, we can get four HTTP messages due to the refresh of the page. We can get many details of the messages from the packet-contents window.  
        * While we can't find a "IF-MODIFIED-SINCE" in the first HTTP GET message, we can see a "IF-MODIFIED-SINCE" in the second HTTP GET message since in the first HTTP request, the info of the page is modified at ***Thu, 03 Mar 2022 06:59:01 GMT***.  The server explicitly return the contents of the file in the first call, we can see in the **"Line-based text data"**. However, that's not happen in the second HTTP GET as the status code is **304 NOT MODIFIED**, which means the file is not changed.  
        ![ConditionalHTTP.png](https://s2.loli.net/2022/03/03/tDXg9NA4CevGpHU.png)  

        (3) Retrieving Long Documents:  
        * In this lab, we can get two HTTP messages, but after the HTTP GET message, there are many TCP messages. 
        * In our lab here, the HTML file is rather long, and at 4500 bytes is too large to fit in one TCP packet.  The single HTTP response message is thus broken into several pieces by TCP, with each piece being contained within a separate TCP segment and captured by Wireshark. We can see from the HTTP 200 OK that there are four TCP segments in response to our only one HTTP GET message: **packet 40,41,42,44**. The packet 44 contains the status and phrase associated with the response to the HTTP GET request, the status is **200 OK**. We find that four data-containing TCP segments were needed to carry the single HTTP response and the text of the Bill of Rights.  
        ![Retrieving](https://s2.loli.net/2022/03/03/S5oImZTXBhdcp1t.png)  

        (4) HTML Documents with Embedded Objects:  
        * In this lab, we can get six HTTP messages, three HTTP GET messages and three HTTP OK messages. We now concertrate on the IP of the source and destination.  
        * We find that the first two HTTP GET messages are sent to ***128.119.245.12***, the last HTTP GET message is sent to ***178.79.137.164***. And we also learn that the two images are download  in serially as we can see in the HTTP GET messages that the **Connection: keep-alive**.  
        ![EmbeddedHTTP.png](https://s2.loli.net/2022/03/03/YavJI5Fq8hPnZ9c.png)   

        (5) HTTP Authentication:  
        * In this lab, we can get four HTTP messages. We now focus on the status and phrase of the messages.  
        * We find that the server’s response (status code and phrase) in response to the initial HTTP GET message from our browser is **401 Unauthorized**. When our browser’s sends the HTTP GET message for the second time, the message **Authorization: Basic d2lyZXNoYXJrLXN0dWRlbnRzOm5ldHdvcms=** is added.If those the messages **(d2lyZXNoYXJrLXN0dWRlbnRz)** are translated from Base64 encoding to ASCII encoding, we can see that our username is displayed. If the remains are translated from Base64 encoding to ASCII encoding, we see that our password is displayed!  
        ![Author.png](https://s2.loli.net/2022/03/03/xVbT9r6AXvmR5eL.png)
    3. ##### 【Conclusion】:  
        * Different messages can display as different status codes and phrases.  
        * If the messages are far big, it may call TCP to help with exchange messages.  
        * We can read many details we needed from the packet-details window. We should check carefully with our packets.
